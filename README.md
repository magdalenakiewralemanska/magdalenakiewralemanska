### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Magda!
I am a beginner Java programmer. I am interested in creating applications that will make people's lives easier, respond to their everyday needs, but will also help them fill their free time and relax. Currently, I mainly work on small web applications. In the future, however, I would also like to expand my knowledge in creating computer games and mobile applications. Below are some sample applications that I have worked on so far. If you are interested in working with me, would like to share your experiences or create a joint project, let me know on my linkedIn profile.

I'm working on my first backend projects combined with frontend using Java, React and Angular.

Taking into account my previous education and experience, I feel best in backend applications using Java, including the Spring framework and using relational databases.
