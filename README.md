### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Magda!
I am a beginner Java programmer. I am interested in creating applications that will make people's lives easier, respond to their everyday needs, but will also help them fill their free time and relax. Currently, I mainly work on small web applications. In the future, however, I would also like to expand my knowledge in creating computer games and mobile applications. Below are some sample applications that I have worked on so far. If you are interested in working with me, would like to share your experiences or create a joint project, let me know on my linkedIn profile.
