### Hello World ?
I am a beginner Java programmer. I am interested in creating applications that will make people's lives easier, respond to their everyday needs, but will also help them fill their free time and relax. Currently, I mainly work on small web applications. In the future, however, I would also like to expand my knowledge in creating computer games and mobile applications. Below are some sample applications that I have worked on so far. If you are interested in working with me, would like to share your experiences or create a joint project, let me know on my [<img align="left" alt="linked-in" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" />](https://www.linkedin.com/in/magdalena-kiewra-lema%C5%84ska/).
I'm working on my first backend projects combined with frontend using Java, React and Angular.

Taking into account my previous education and experience, I feel best in backend applications using Java, including the Spring framework.
